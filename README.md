Welcome to my first website project

In this project I aim to use bootstrap to effectivly make a website. Since I have very little imagination or creativty I think the aim of the website that im creating should be website about to me(a little narcissist, I know). In other word im creating a small portfolio. The contents of the porfolio will include a contact page, an about page and a blog page. I want to make the website as compatable as possible which is why ive decided to use bootstrap. What i mean to say is i would like the website to run smoothly on both large and smaller screens such as mobiles or tablets.
