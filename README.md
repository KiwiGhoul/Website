# Welcome to my first website project

In this project I aim to use bootstrap to effectivly make a website. Since I have very little imagination or creativty, I think the aim of the website that im creating should be website about to me(a little narcissist, I know). In other word im creating a small portfolio. The contents of the porfolio will include a contact page, an about page and a blog page. I want to make the website as compatable as possible which is why ive decided to use bootstrap. What i mean to say is i would like the website to run smoothly on both large and smaller screens such as mobiles or tablets.


## UX Design

With User expierence in mind made the website homepage simple and not too complicated . Navigation around the pages is easy and pleasent. Made sure that the webpages could be seen on both large and small screens. regarding that , I feel like it actually looks better on smaller screens. Tested on all browsers, no problems.

## Navbar

* All hrefs/links work as intended.
* Font size was increased as to allow better visibility both on small screens and desktop.
* Font color was changed to stand out against the background.



## Features 

1. Made navbar collapse so it should be able to be seen clearly on smaller screens --- ease of navigation
2. larger font ---looks better and ease of navigation
3. Made form to contact me on, not yet fuctional
4. Carousel fuctional , nice pictures of my cat.
5. Works on all browers--confirmed
6. Forms do not work - will return and fix backend

* Carousel not working as intended -- fixed 
* About page, image not scaling down properly and seems out of place. fixed scaling down but still cant get it in the right place on smaller screens.
* footer was acting strange on small screens and was displaying in the center, on index. --changed it, working correctly
