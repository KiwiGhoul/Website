Welcome to my first website project

In this project I aim to use bootstrap to effectivly make a website. Since I have very little imagination or creativty, I think the aim of the website that im creating should be website about to me(a little narcissist, I know). In other word im creating a small portfolio. The contents of the porfolio will include a contact page, an about page and a blog page. I want to make the website as compatable as possible which is why ive decided to use bootstrap. What i mean to say is i would like the website to run smoothly on both large and smaller screens such as mobiles or tablets.


UX Design

With User expierence in mind made the website homepage simple and not too complicated . Navigation around the pages is easy and pleasent. Made sure that the webpages could be seen on both large and small screens. regarding that , I feel like it actually looks better on smaller screens. Tested on all browsers, no problems.


Features 

1. Made navbar collapse so it should be able to be seen clearly on smaller screens --- ease of navigation
2. larger font ---looks better and ease of navigation
3. Made form to contact me on, not yet fuctional
4. Made carousel but confident it works. will report as bug for now.



Bugs
1.fixed toggle, accidently deleted div tag and misspelled toggle, also had div tag in wrong place. My mistake ---all is working correctly 
2.background seemed to snap back to the the beginning, made it hard to concentrate --- added adtional keyframes step to make sure background animation was smooth
3.Carousel not working as intended
