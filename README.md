Welcome to my first website project

In this project I aim to use bootstrap to effectivly make a website. Since I have very little imagination or creativty I think the aim of the website that im creating should be website about to me(a little narcissist, I know). In other word im creating a small portfolio. The contents of the porfolio will include a contact page, an about page and a blog page. I want to make the website as compatable as possible which is why ive decided to use bootstrap. What i mean to say is i would like the website to run smoothly on both large and smaller screens such as mobiles or tablets.

Features 

1. Made navbar collapse so it should be able to be seen clearly on smaller screens --- ease of navigation
2. larger font ---looks better and ease of navigation



Bugs
1.fixed toggle, accidently deleted div tag and misspelled toggle, also had div tag in wrong place. My mistake ---all is working correctly
